What this script does is download last 10 pages from recent torrents in a category (TV shows and Movies) and counts how many times which of them was downloaded. This was a feature i was missing when you want to see what was new and hot for lets say last day.

pirate.py - loads files sequentially, then process them, spits out plain text

pirate_multi.py - uses threads for fetching pages and produces plain text

pirates_multi_html.py - uses threads, and make html page with links

pirates.sh - activates virtualenv with BeatifulSoup, requests, jinja2, 
  then starts script, and opens the page in chrome browser
